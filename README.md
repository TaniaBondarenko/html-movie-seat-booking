# html-movie-seat-booking
<p>This is small project of the first stage for booking seats in the cinema. </p>
<p>It's easy to understand and easy to use.</p>
<p>Here I've used my knowledge of HTML and CSS to implement my vision of how the cinema booking page should looks like:
<ul>
<li>simple</li>
<li>intelligible</li>
<li>user friendly</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Seats are in the different price range. It differs by color. User can choose/unchoose particular seat and see it price.</p>
